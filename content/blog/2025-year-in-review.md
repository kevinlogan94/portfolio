2025 was the biggest year of growth I've had in my entire life! This year, I pushed myself to greater limits and challenged myself in ways that I'd never been challenged before, all as part of a commitment to achieve a goal of having my 30s be the best decade of my life.

I want to look back when I'm older and see all the great things that I accomplished. Below, you'll see exactly what those things were. Each one of these things I'm truly proud of! And I could not be more thankful for the supporters and people around me who helped me through each one of these obstacles, helping me show up as the best version of myself.

Here is what I accomplished in 2025:

## Choosing myself by quitting my job

I realized that I had become too comfortable at my current job, so I decided to quit. During that period, I locked in on interview prep and landed an offer as an engineering lead within a week. This was a necessary risk that brought a newfound confidence to my life and changed my entire view of social media and how it tries to control us.

## Built a Sales Conversational AI

I dived deeper into the industry, designing and building my own sales conversational AI. This allowed me to take a hard look at the AI space and just how much it is evolving.

## Went Head-to-Head with Meta

I spent 4 months training day in and day out for some of the hardest engineering interviews in the world. I can't stress enough how transformative this process was. It was a strong reminder of just how important discipline is when it comes to accomplishing your goals. This was one of the most mentally demanding experiences of my entire life.

## Solved over 100 LeetCode Problems

LeetCode problems are essentially coding puzzles that are actively used in technical interviews. I quickly learned that these are some of the hardest puzzles you can come across. Solving 100 of them took consistent effort, but allowed me to ace several coding interviews that I came across.

## Terrified my audience at The Dent Schoolhouse 

The Dent Schoolhouse is one of the top-ranked haunted houses in the country, and I had the opportunity to play several characters, bringing the house to life. It was truly an incredible experience that I couldn't be more thankful for!

## Traveled across the country and made a side quest across the world

This year, I traveled to New Zealand, Seattle, San Francisco, Denver, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Nashville, and Charlotte—all in an attempt to figure out where I wanted to spend the next chapter of my life. This experience is one I highly recommend to anyone who wants to see what truly lies out there! After going on so many trips and asking myself, "What am I doing with my life?", I finally took the opportunity to go after true growth and find a new home for myself.

## Faced the ghosts of Haunted Hillview Manor

During my travels, I went to Haunted Hillview Manor right outside Pittsburgh. This place is known as a destination that contains a portal to Hell. It is incredibly haunted, and during my time there, I encountered a lot of things that I truly cannot put into words. To say the least, it was one of the most terrifying experiences I ever had. It is an experience I will never forget and has truly changed how I look at spirituality.

## Leveled Up My Business

I moved out of my duplex and hired a property manager to take it over. This is a step toward my real estate business flourishing! Now that the giant project of getting my duplex up and running is complete, I can turn this business into a fully operational revenue stream.

None of these achievements were simple. Each of them required patience, discipline, and a true inner belief in myself. I could not be more proud of how far I've come, and I am thrilled to see how much further I can go! I have so many ideas, so many exciting opportunities, and so many goals that I plan on piercing through just like I did this year.

I cannot wait to share all the things that I'm cooking up behind the scenes right now. 2026 is going to be a year to remember!
