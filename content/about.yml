  Hi, I'm **Kevin Logan**, a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Team Lead based in Cincinnati, OH. I design and ship scalable systems across the stack—Vue 3, TypeScript, .NET Core, SQL, AWS—and lead through architecture, code, and mentorship. At **NaviStone**, I partnered with leadership to architect and deliver platform capabilities, drive AI innovation, and grow engineers through code reviews, pairing, and clear technical direction.
  ## My Engineering Philosophy  

  I believe the best engineering combines clarity, simplicity, and foresight. My focus is on breaking down complexity into clean, scalable solutions while ensuring the people around me have the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Whether I'm architecting a system, building a feature, or mentoring a developer, my goal is always to deliver results that are impactful and sustainable.  

  ## What Drives Me  

  What excites me most about this field is the mix of problem-solving and people. I love collaborating with others to turn big ideas into practical solutions, and I find it incredibly rewarding to see teammates grow and overcome their own limits. I also have a deep passion for learning and enjoy exploring new technologies that keep me sharp and forward-thinking.  

  ## Beyond the Screen  

  Outside of work, I enjoy improv, weightlifting, exploring anime and manga, and diving into movies — especially Lord of the Rings and The Dark Knight Trilogy. I also manage a small real estate business, owning and operating a duplex, which has taught me a lot about balancing responsibility, relationships, and long-term investment. I like experimenting with men's fashion and personal style, and I make time to connect with friends and family through travel, game nights, or simply catching up.
