  Hi, I'm **Kevin Logan**, an Engineering Leader and developer based in Cincinnati, OH. Over the past several years, I've led engineering teams, designed scalable backend architectures, and shipped systems that power customer-facing platforms. At NaviStone, I partnered with the CTO to define technical strategy, scale the team from the ground up, and mentor engineers into leadership roles. My career has spanned everything from microservices and front-end frameworks to AI integrations, and I thrive at the intersection of technical execution and team growth.  

  ## My Engineering Philosophy  

  I believe the best engineering combines clarity, simplicity, and foresight. My focus is on breaking down complexity into clean, scalable solutions while ensuring the people around me have the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Whether I'm architecting a system, building a feature, or mentoring a developer, my goal is always to deliver results that are impactful and sustainable.  

  ## What Drives Me  

  What excites me most about this field is the mix of problem-solving and people. I love collaborating with others to turn big ideas into practical solutions, and I find it incredibly rewarding to see teammates grow and overcome their own limits. I also have a deep passion for learning and enjoy exploring new technologies that keep me sharp and forward-thinking.  

  ## Beyond the Screen  

  Outside of work, I enjoy improv, weightlifting, exploring anime and manga, and diving into movies â€” especially Lord of the Rings and The Dark Knight Trilogy. I also manage a small real estate business, owning and operating a duplex, which has taught me a lot about balancing responsibility, relationships, and long-term investment. I like experimenting with men's fashion and personal style, and I make time to connect with friends and family through travel, game nights, or simply catching up.
